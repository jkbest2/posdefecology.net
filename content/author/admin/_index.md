John Best is a graduate student in the [Punt Lab](https://puntlab.washington.edu) at the University of Washington. He is in the third year of his PhD in the [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM)](https://depts.washington.edu/qerm/) program. His research focuses on applying spatial and spatiotemporal modeling techniques to questions in ecology and particulary fisheries science. He is developing spatiotemporal models to combine fishery-independent (survey) and fishery-dependent data in an effort to improve indices of abundance. He is also developing techniques to improve spatial models by including nonstationary spatial effects. An additional project is focused on improving parameterizations for Bayesian state-space models to reduce bias and computation time.
