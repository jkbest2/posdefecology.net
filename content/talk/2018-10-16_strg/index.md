abstract = "A discussion of [Chapter 1 in Advanced Spatial Modeling with SPDEs using R and INLA](https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/spde-gitbook/ch-INLA.html) for the Autumn 2018 Space-time reading group at the University of Washington. This chapter focuses on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and its applications in estimating regression models using the `INLA` package in R. Examples of increasing complexity using a toy data set are included."
