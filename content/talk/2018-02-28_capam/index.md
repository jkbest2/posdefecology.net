abstract = "Spatially-explicit catch and effort data is increasingly available, and may provide an important source of information for estimating abundance. There is potential to improve abundance estimates by combining fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data. To measure the potential effect of combining these data, a fishery will be simulated with both survey and fishery vessels, each with their own targeting behavior. Abundance will be estimated using only the survey observations and with both survey and fishery observations. The variation in these estimates will then be compared. Spatially-explicit catch and effort data is likely to provide a substantial decrease in estimation variation. This should provide guidance in the expected change in estimation variation that may occur when these data are included."
